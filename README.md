# hello-world
My first repository on github.

Hi!

John here. I am a musician and I am studying journalism. As a person with above-average knowledge of how to use computers, and to be able to fix almost every problem I've encountered on the surface, it has always been a personal problem for me that I don't know how to code. I will try to do something about that now. 

Best regards, 
John.
